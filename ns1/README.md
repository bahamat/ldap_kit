# Stand-alone NS1 Crypt/Decrypt Tool

This tool can crypt/decrypt `{NS1}` password hashes used by the Solaris Native
LDAP implementation.  It is based on the work of Iain Patterson who was kind
enough to blog the process/code and save me the time of doing it myself.  See
his entry here:

Download the required Solaris code here:

<https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/tree/master/usr/src/lib/libsldap/common>

This tool can only be compiled on illumos or Solaris.
